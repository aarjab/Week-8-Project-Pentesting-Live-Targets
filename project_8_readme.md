# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking/Fixation
![](https://github.com/aarjab/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/SessionHijacking.gif)
Changes the user session between different browsers
Vulnerability #2: SQLi
![](https://github.com/aarjab/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/SQLi.gif)
Used SQL injection on the php url

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
![](https://github.com/aarjab/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/CrossSiteScripting.gif)
Inserted "<script>alert('XSS!');</script>" on the feedback form to display data
Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
![](https://github.com/aarjab/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/UsernameEnumeration.gif)
Notification is bold when user is already created and not bold when user is not created

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Object Reference
![](https://github.com/aarjab/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/InsecureDirectObjectReference.gif)
Change the id in the url to access people that should not be accessed
Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
![](https://github.com/aarjab/Week-8-Project-Pentesting-Live-Targets/blob/master/CrossSiteRequestForgey.gif)
The site accepts a POST request from a different source and updates the database
